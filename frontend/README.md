## Overview

### The challenge

The Product feedback app is a simple app that allows users of a particular product to provide feedback on the app. Users can:

- Create, read, update, and delete product feedback requests
- Sort suggestions by most/least upvotes and most/least comments
- Filter suggestions by category
- Add comments and replies to a product feedback request
- Upvote product feedback requests
- View the full roadmap of the product. See what is in progress, what has been done and what is planned for the future
- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size

## Development

### Install and Run

1. First, download the repository:

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:transferwise/partner-hub-ui.git
```

2. Now install the dependencies and run the project:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Testing

Just execute the `test` task:

```sh
$ yarn test
```

You can also execute `eslint` with:

```sh
$ yarn run lint
```

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
